        <div class="leading-7 md:text-lg md:leading-10">
            <p class="my-5">I'm an enthusiastic Full-Stack Developer with an expanding interest in solving problems using efficient solutions. I learned HTML and CSS in middle school and over the years I have been building my development skills alongside my communication skills and professionalism.</p>
            <p class="my-5">After college I had the privilege to work for a daycare management software, Fastoche, where I strengthened my PHP, MySQL, JavaScript and CSS knowledge. Being a Full-stack Developer I had the opportunity to be a part of creating amazing features for daycare centres while expanding my knowledge in both front-end and back-end development.</p>
            <p class="my-5">Currently, I am a Software Developer for Scootaround, a great MaaS (Mobility as a Service) company that offers mobility equipment rentals in over 2500 locations. Every day I apply my skills to help refine, refactor, and reform internal software to aid our day-to-day operation both frontend and backend. Scootaround has taught me how to effectively work and communicate within a team and stretch my critical thinking around business logic.</p>
            <p class="my-5">Throughout my developer journey I have learned a few things about being a developer:
            <ul class="text-sm md:text-base text-sky-900 font-semibold sm:pl-10">
                <li class="my-4 border-l-4 border-sky-600 pl-4">It's okay to take on challenges and own it, but know when to ask for help.</li>
                <li class="my-4 border-l-4 border-sky-600 pl-4">Stumbling across a page begging to be refactored doesn't mean you always have to fix it then. Make a //TODO and move on.</li>
                <li class="my-4 border-l-4 border-sky-600 pl-4">Take time to understand what and who you're developing for. Knowing business operations/logic can allow you to make wiser decisions for user experience, performance and scalability.</li>
                <li class=" my-4 border-l-4 border-sky-600 pl-4">Ask questions. Answer questions. Make suggestions. Listen and learn.</li>
            </ul>
